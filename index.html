                  <span>What is Mead?</span>
                  <p>Not beer, not wine, Mead! <br> <br>
                        It’s its own distinct category, somewhere between beer and wine. <br>
                        It’s honey and water fermented by yeast, but it can also be flavored with fruits, spices, grains
                        and/or hops. <br> <br>
                        You’d sip it like a beer, wine, or cider. <br>
                        Mead, although made from honey, is not always sweet. <br>
                        Mead is believed to be the first form of alcohol to ever be discovered. </p>

                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>People ask us how we got into the mead business. The answer is simple, to offer an
                              alcoholic beverage alternative to beer, wine and hard liquor. But why mead, why not sake?
                              That answer is also a simple one, the owner and founder Jeff Kesling Jr. loves honey. </p>
                        <p> So how does a love of honey and an interest in alcohol translate into mead? It starts, like
                              many home-brews, with experimentation.It took this mead a year to finally taste palatable,
                              but is now remembered very fondly by all of us. After making the first few, and having
                              them all 
                              turn out wonderfully,Jeff
                              Sr. decided Jeff Jr. should pursue a license. The process to get the license was long and
                              grueling, it ended up taking us over 8 months. Then came the learning process involving
                              the labeling and formulas aspect, which took us another 6 months. After all the waiting,
                              we finally opened our doors on April 1, 2017.
