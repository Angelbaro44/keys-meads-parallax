                                    <p>Not beer, not wine, Mead!</p> <br>


                                    <p>
                                          Mead is an alcoholic beverage made from honey. Although it falls into the
                                          legal classification
                                          of wine, it is drastically different. Mead, although made from honey, is not
                                          always sweet. The
                                          Mazer (mead maker) can change the recipe to produce anything from completely
                                          dry (no sugar) to a
                                          dessert mead.

                                          The first difference between wine and mead, is that wine is an alcoholic
                                          beverage made through
                                          fermenting fruit, where mead is fermented from honey.

                                    <p>
                                          The most notable difference between wine and mead is the taste. Wine made from
                                          grapes, the most
                                          common form of wine, has tannins present in the skin of the grapes. Tannins
                                          are what give grape
                                          wines the distinct dry mouthfeel many people associate with wines, especially
                                          dry reds. Mead on
                                          the other hand, unless fermented along with grapes or other fruit high in
                                          tannins, does not have
                                          the dry mouthfeel. This difference makes mead stand out in a world filled with
                                          wines and beers.

                                          Mead is believed to be the first form of alcohol to be discovered. Many people
                                          have never heard
                                          of it, but most have seen it consumed in TV programs and movies, mostly those
                                          taking place in
                                          Viking or Renaissance eras. It was known as the Nectar of the Gods and was
                                          commonly drank from
                                          horns, chalices, goblets or steins.

                                          Mead is also where the term honeymoon originated. The term refers to the
                                          requirement of a dowry
                                          to contain a month (a moon) worth of mead. It was (my wife and I agree with
                                          this) believed that
                                          mead helps a couple to conceive a child during the honeymoon.

                                    <p>
                                          A melomel is a mead fermented with added fruits. These fruits are added for
                                          flavor, and are in addition to the honey. Examples of these meads include
                                          Plum, Blueberry and Key Lime. This is our most varied mead category and we are
                                          constantly trying out new fruits. We only use whole fruits, often and whenever
                                          possible, hand picked by us.

                                    <p>
                                          A methleglin is a mead made with the addition of spices, it is the traditional
                                          name for a spiced mead. Our 2016 Homebrew Competition Peoples Choice Award
                                          winner is a methleglin we named Holiday Spiced Mead. Another example is our
                                          Orange Cream, which is imbued with vanilla bean.
