                                    <p>People ask us how we got into the mead business. The answer is simple, to offer
                                          an alcoholic beverage alternative to beer, wine and hard liquor. But why mead,
                                          why not sake? That answer is also a simple one, the owner and founder Jeff
                                          Kesling Jr. loves honey. As a sidebar, Jeff Sr. spent part of our opening day
                                          describing, to anyone who would listen, that his reason for getting into this
                                          business was for his son to make Horseradish Mead.

                                          So how does a love of honey and an interest in alcohol translate into mead? It
                                          starts, like many home-brews, with experimentation. Jeff Jr. and a few of his
                                          friends, decided to start by making a pineapple mead. We later found out
                                          pineapple is a very difficult fruit to make alcohol using, so we started with
                                          a high difficulty brew. It took this mead a year to finally taste palatable,
                                          but is now remembered very fondly by all of us. We have a single bottle
                                          remaining, and those friends that were there at the beginning are constantly
                                          eyeballing the bottle, and trying to sneak out with it.

                                          After the long wait for that first mead, Jeff Jr. started making more in an
                                          attempt to refine the technique. After making the first few, and having them
                                          all turn out wonderfully, Jeff's father, Jeff Sr. decided Jeff Jr. should
                                          pursue a license. The process to get the license was long and grueling, it
                                          ended up taking us over 8 months. Then came the learning process involving the
                                          labeling and formulas aspect, which took us another 6 months. After all the
                                          waiting, we finally opened our doors on April 1, 2017.

                                          In November, 2017, the tasting room was moved to Unit 11 (next door @ top of
                                          stairs). Unit 12 is now devoted to manufacturing, to handle distribution of
                                          our meads.

                                          In March, 2020 we moved our operation about 200 ft. north to a much larger,
                                          and ground level location. We added a beautiful mural that is becoming a
                                          landmark in Key Largo, painted by the talented Ginger Hill, a local artist.

                                          In February 2021 we are now also a distillery. Look for our new spirits and
                                          liqours over the next few months.
